                        A <b>VTuber</b> (Japanese: ブイチューバー, Hepburn: BuiChūbā) or 
                        <b>virtual YouTuber</b> (バーチャルユーチューバー, bācharu YūChūbā) 
                        is an online entertainer who uses a virtual avatar 
                        generated using computer graphics. Real-time motion 
                        capture software or technology are often—but not 
                        always—used to capture movement. The digital trend 
                        originated in Japan in the mid-2010s, and has become 
                        an international online phenomenon in the 
                        2020s.<sup>[1][2]</sup> A majority of VTubers are English 
                        and Japanese-speaking YouTubers or live streamers who 
                        use avatar designs. By 2020, there were more than 
                        10,000 active VTubers.<sup>[3]</sup> Although the term 
                        is an allusion to the video platform YouTube, they also 
                        use websites such as Niconico, Twitch, Facebook, 
                        Twitter, and Bilibili.

                        The first entertainer to use the phrase "virtual YouTuber", 
                        Kizuna AI, began creating content on YouTube in late 2016. 
                        Her popularity sparked a VTuber trend in Japan, and spurred 
                        the establishment of specialized agencies to promote them, 
                        including major ones such as Hololive Production, Nijisanji, 
                        and VShojo. Fan translations and foreign-language VTubers 
                        have marked a rise in the trend's international 
                        popularity.<sup>[4]</sup> Virtual YouTubers have appeared in 
                        domestic advertising campaigns, and have broken 
                        livestream-related world records.

                    Virtual YouTubers (although more commonly referred to as 
                    VTubers) are online entertainers who are typically YouTubers 
                    or live streamers. They use avatars created with programs 
                    such as Live2D, portraying characters designed by online 
                    artists.<sup>[5]</sup> VTubers are not bound by physical 
                    limitations, and many of them engage in activities that are 
                    unconstrained by their real-world identity.<sup>[6][7]</sup> 
                    Some VTubers, particularly those from marginalized 
                    communities, choose to use avatars to reflect their online 
                    identity for personal comfort and safety 
                    reasons.<sup>[8][9]</sup> Transgender VTubers may use their 
                    avatars as a means to better reflect their preferred 
                    presentation to their audience.<sup>[10]</sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    VTubers often portray themselves as a kayfabe character, not 
                    unlike professional wrestling; Mace, a WWE wrestler who 
                    himself began streaming on Twitch as a VTuber in 2021, 
                    remarked that the two professions were "literally the same 
                    thing".<sup>[11]</sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    VTubers are associated with Japanese popular culture and 
                    aesthetics, such as anime and manga,<sup>[6][12]</sup> and 
                    moe anthropomorphism with human or non-human 
                    traits.<sup>[6]</sup> Some VTubers use anthropomorphic 
                    avatars, non-human characters such as 
                    animals.<sup>[13]</sup>
                </p>

                <p>
                    A VTuber's avatar is typically animated using a webcam and 
                    software, which captures the streamer's motions, 
                    expressions, and mouth movements, and maps them to a two- 
                    or three-dimensional model. Both free and paid programs have 
                    been developed for loading models and performing motion 
                    capture, with some capable of being used without a webcam 
                    (albeit with pre-determined animations), and some also 
                    supporting virtual reality hardware, or hand tracking 
                    devices such as the Leap Motion 
                    Controller.<sup>[14][15][16][17]</sup> Some programs use 
                    iPhone smartphones—particularly, those that include Face 
                    ID—as an external webcam, using their infrared-illuminated 
                    sensor for more precise motion capture.<sup>[17]</sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The proprietary animation software Live2D is typically used 
                    to rig two-dimensional models constructed from drawn 
                    textures, while programs such as VRoid Studio can be used to 
                    create three-dimensional models.<sup>[14][15][16]</sup> 
                    Commissioned models can cost as high as US$2,000 depending 
                    on their level of detail.<sup>[18]</sup> By contrast, some 
                    VTubers, colloquially known as "PNGTubers" (in reference to 
                    the PNG image format), use static sprites as opposed to a 
                    rigged model.<sup>[19]</sup>

                    Alternative open-source software has been introduced, such 
                    as Inochi2D, which aims to serve the same purpose of Live2D 
                    in an open source manner. Such software is not backwards 
                    compatible with the Live2D standard, due to Live2D's 
                    anti-competitive license compatibility.[20] There is also 
                    open source 3D VTubing software such as the Virtual Puppet 
                    Project (vpuppr) that is compatible with former proprietary 
                    3D Vtubing software due to the model format's open source 
                    nature.<sup>[21]</sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    More recently, some Vtubers have introduced artificial 
                    intelligence into the design of their characters using 
                    AI-generated art and have even integrated AI into their core 
                    personality, gameplay, and chat 
                    interaction.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

                <p>
                    Major VTubers are often employed by talent agencies, with 
                    business models influenced by those used by Japanese idol 
                    agencies. Streamers are employed by an agency to portray 
                    characters developed by the company, which are then 
                    commercialized via merchandising and other promotional 
                    appearances, as well as traditional revenue streams such as 
                    monetization of their videos, and viewer donations. The use 
                    of the term "graduation" to refer to a streamer retiring 
                    their character and/or leaving an agency, is also a holdover 
                    from the idol industry.<sup>[22][23]</sup>

                    On February 12, 2010, visual novel maker Nitroplus began 
                    uploading videos to its YouTube channel featuring an 
                    animated 3D version of its mascot Super Sonico, who would 
                    usually talk to the audience about herself or about releases 
                    related to the 
                    company.<sup>[24][non-primary source needed]</sup> 
                    On June 13, 2011, UK-based Japanese vlogger Ami Yamato 
                    uploaded her first video, which featured an animated, 
                    virtual avatar speaking to the camera.<sup>[7][25]</sup> 
                    In 2012, Japanese company Weathernews Inc. debuted a 
                    Vocaloid-styled character called Weatheroid Type A Airi on 
                    SOLiVE24, a 24-hour weather live stream on Nico Nico Douga, 
                    on YouTube and their website.<sup>[26][27][28][non-primary 
                        source needed]</sup> In 2014, Airi got her own solo 
                        program every Thursday and began live broadcasting with 
                        motion capture.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

                    In 2014 the FaceRig indie software launched on Indiegogo as 
                    an EU crowdfunding project, and later that year it was 
                    released on Steam, becoming the first software suite that 
                    enabled live avatars at home via face motion capture that 
                    started being actively used on streaming websites and 
                    YouTube. The Live2D software module enabling 2D avatars and 
                    was added one year later in 2015 in collaboration with 
                    Live2D, Inc.

                    In late 2016, Kizuna AI, the first VTuber to achieve 
                    breakout popularity,<sup>[29][7][30]</sup> made her debut on 
                    YouTube. She was the first to coin and use the term "virtual 
                    YouTuber". Created by digital production company Activ8 and 
                    voice-acted by Nozomi Kasuga,<sup>[7][31]</sup> Kizuna AI 
                    created a sense of "real intimacy" with fans, as she was 
                    responsive to their questions. Within ten months, she had 
                    over two million subscribers and later became a culture 
                    ambassador of the Japan National Tourism 
                    Organization.<sup>[32]</sup> Kizuna Ai's popularity can be 
                    attributed to the oversaturation of traditional webcam 
                    YouTubers and for aspects of characters that the audience 
                    would not expect. For example, despite having a friendly 
                    appearance, Kizuna Ai often swears in her videos when she 
                    gets frustrated while playing a game.<sup>[33]</sup>
