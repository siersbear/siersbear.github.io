            <b>Graphic design</b> is a <a href="#">profession,<sup>[2]</sup></a>
            <a href="#">academicdiscipline<sup>[3][4][5]</sup></a> and 
            <a href="#">applied art</a> whose activity consists in projecting 
            <a href="#">visual communication</a> intended to transmit specific 
            messages to social groups, with specific 
            objectives.<a href="#"><sup>[6]</sup></a> Graphic design is an 
            interdisciplinary  branch of <a href="#">design<sup>[1]</sup></a> 
            and of the fine arts. Its practice involves 
            <a href="#">creativity</a>, <a href="#">innovation</a> and 
            <a href="#">lateral thinking</a> using manual or 
            <a href="#">digital tools</a>, where it is usual to use text and 
            graphics to communicate visually.

            The role of the <a href="#">graphic designer</a> in the communication 
            process is that of encoder or interpreter of the message. They work on 
            the interpretation, ordering, and presentation of visual messages. 
            Usually, graphic design uses the <a href="#">aesthetics</a> of 
            <a href="#">typography</a> and the compositional arrangement of the 
            text, ornamentation, and imagery to convey ideas, feelings, and 
            attitudes beyond what language alone expresses. The design work can be 
            based on a customer's demand, a demand that ends up being established 
            linguistically, either orally or in writing, that is, that graphic 
            design transforms a linguistic message into a graphic 
            manifestation.<a href="#"><sup>[7]</sup></a>
        </p>
         <p>
            Graphic design has, as a field of application, different areas of 
            knowledge focused on any visual communication system. For example, it 
            can be applied in advertising strategies, or it can also be applied in 
            the <a href="#">aviation</a> world<sup>[8]</sup> or <a href="#">space 
            exploration.<sup>[9][10]</sup></a> In this sense, in some countries 
            graphic design is related as only associated with the production of 
            sketches and drawings, this is incorrect, since visual communication 
            is a small part of a huge range of types and classes where it can be 
            applied.
        </p>
        <p>
            With origins in <a href="#">Antiquity</a> and <a href="#">the 
            <sup>Middle Ages,[11]</sup></a> graphic design as applied art was 
            initially linked to the boom of <a href="#">rise of printing</a> in 
            Europe in the 15th century and the growth of consumer culture in the 
            <a href="#">Industrial Revolution</a>. From there it emerged as a 
            distinct profession in the West, closely associated with 
            <a href="#">advertising</a> in the 19th century<sup>[12]</sup> and 
            its evolution allowed its consolidation in the 20th century. Given 
            the rapid and massive growth in information exchange today, the 
            demand for experienced designers is greater than ever, particularly 
            because of the development of new technologies and the need to pay 
            attention to human factors beyond the competence of the engineers 
            who develop them.<sup>[13]</sup>

            <i>Main article: <a href="#">History of graphic design</i></a>

        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="#">William Addison Dwiggins</a> is often credited with 
            first using the term 
            "graphic design" in a 1922 article,<sup>[14]</sup> although it appears in a 4 
            July 1908 issue (volume 9, number 27) of Organized Labor, a 
            publication of the Labor Unions of San Francisco, in an article 
            about technical education for printers:<sup>[15]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            An Enterprising Trades Union
            … The admittedly high standard of intelligence which prevails among 
            printers is an assurance that with the elemental principles of 
            design at their finger ends many of them will grow in knowledge and 
            develop into specialists in graphic design and decorating. …
        </p>
        <p>
            A decade later, the 1917–1918 course catalog of the <a href="#">California 
            School of Arts & Crafts</a> advertised a course titled Graphic Design 
            and Lettering, which replaced one called Advanced Design and 
            Lettering. Both classes were taught by 
            <a href="#">Frederick Meyer.<sup>[16]</sup></a>
        </p>
        <h2 id="history">History</h2>

        <p>
            In both its lengthy history and in the relatively recent explosion 
            of <a href="#">visual communication</a> in the 20th and 21st centuries, the 
            distinction between advertising, art, graphic design and fine art 
            has disappeared. They share many elements, theories, principles, 
            practices, <a href="#">languages</a> and sometimes the same benefactor or client. 
            In advertising, the ultimate objective is the sale of goods and 
            services. In graphic design, "the essence is to give order to 
            information, form to ideas, expression, and feeling to artifacts 
            that document the human experience."<sup>[17]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            The definition of the graphic designer profession is relatively 
            recent concerning its preparation, activity, and objectives. 
            Although there is no consensus on an exact date when graphic design 
            emerged, some date it back to the <a href="#">Interwar period.</a> 
            Others understand that it began to be identified as such by the late 
            19th century.<sup>[11]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            It can be argued that graphic communications with specific purposes 
            have their origins in Paleolithic cave paintings and the birth of 
            written language in the third millennium BCE. However, the 
            differences in working methods, auxiliary sciences, and required 
            training are such that it is not possible to clearly identify the 
            current graphic designer with prehistoric man, the 15th-century 
            xylographer, or the lithographer of 1890.
        </p>
        <p>
            The diversity of opinions stems from some considering any graphic 
            manifestation as a product of graphic design, while others only 
            recognize those that arise as a result of the application of an 
            industrial production model—visual manifestations that have been 
            "projected" to address various needs: productive, symbolic, 
            ergonomic, contextual, among others.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nevertheless, the evolution of graphic design as a practice and 
            profession has been closely linked to technological innovations, 
            social needs, and the visual imagination of professionals.[18] 
            Graphic design has been practiced in various forms throughout 
            history; in fact, good examples of graphic design date back to 
            manuscripts from ancient China, Egypt, and Greece. As printing and 
            book production developed in the 15th century, advances in graphic 
            design continued over the subsequent centuries, with composers or 
            typographers often designing pages according to established type.<sup>[11]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            By the late 19th century, graphic design emerged as a distinct 
            profession in the West, partly due to the process of labor 
            specialization that occurred there and partly due to the new 
            technologies and business possibilities brought about by the 
            Industrial Revolution. New production methods led to the separation 
            of the design of a communication medium (such as a poster) from its
            actual production. Increasingly, throughout the 19th and early 20th 
            centuries, advertising agencies, book publishers, and magazines 
            hired art directors who organized all visual elements of 
            communication and integrated them into a harmonious whole, creating 
            an expression appropriate to the content. In 1922, typographer 
            William A. Dwiggins coined the term graphic design to identify the 
            emerging field.<sup>[11]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout the 20th century, the technology available to designers 
            continued to advance rapidly, as did the artistic and commercial 
            possibilities of design. The profession expanded greatly, and 
            graphic designers created, among other things, magazine pages, 
            book covers, posters, CD covers, postage stamps, packaging, brands, 
            signs, advertisements, kinetic titles for TV programs and movies, 
            and websites. By the early 21st century, graphic design had become 
            a global profession as advanced technology and industry spread 
            worldwide.<sup>[11]</sup>

        <h3>Historical background</h3>
        <p>
            <i>Main article: <a href="#">History of graphic design</i></a>

        </p>
        <p>
            In China, during the Tang dynasty (618–907) wood blocks were cut to 
            print on textiles and later to reproduce Buddhist texts. A Buddhist 
            scripture printed in 868 is the earliest known printed book. 
            Beginning in the 11th century in China, longer scrolls and books 
            were produced using movable type printing, making books widely 
            available during the Song dynasty (960–1279).<sup>[19]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            In the mid-15th century in Mainz, Germany, Johannes Gutenberg 
            developed a way to reproduce printed pages at a faster pace using 
            movable type made with a new metal alloy[20] that created a 
            revolution in the dissemination of information.<sup>[21]</sup>
        </p>
        <h3>Nineteenth century</h3>
        <p>
            In 1849, Henry Cole became one of the major forces in design 
            education in Great Britain, informing the government of the 
            importance of design in his Journal of Design and Manufactures. 
            He organized the Great Exhibition as a celebration of modern 
            industrial technology and Victorian design.
        </p>
        <p>
            From 1891 to 1896, William Morris' Kelmscott Press was a leader 
            in graphic design associated with the Arts and Crafts movement, 
            creating hand-made books in medieval and Renaissance era style,<sup>[22]</sup>
            in addition to wallpaper and textile designs.<sup>[23]</sup> Morris' work, 
            along with the rest of the Private Press movement, directly 
            influenced Art Nouveau.<sup>[24]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            Will H. Bradley became one of the notable graphic designers in the 
            late nineteenth-century due to creating art pieces in various Art 
            Nouveau styles. Bradley created a number of designs as promotions 
            for a literary magazine titled The Chap-Book.<sup>[25]</sup>
        </p>
        <h3>Twentieth century</h3>
        <p>
            In 1917, Frederick H. Meyer, director and instructor at the 
            California School of Arts and Crafts, taught a class entitled 
            "Graphic Design and Lettering".<sup>[26]</sup> Raffe's Graphic Design, 
            published in 1927, was the first book to use "Graphic Design" 
            in its title.<sup>[27]</sup> In 1936, author and graphic designer Leon Friend 
            published his book titled "Graphic Design" and it is known to be the 
            first piece of literature to cover the topic extensively.<sup>[28]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            The signage in the London Underground is a classic design 
            example<sup>[29]</sup> of the modern era. Although he lacked artistic 
            training, Frank Pick led the Underground Group design and publicity 
            movement. The first Underground station signs were introduced in 
            1908 with a design of a solid red disk with a blue bar in the center 
            and the name of the station. The station name was in white 
            sans-serif letters. It was in 1916 when Pick used the expertise of 
            Edward Johnston to design a new typeface for the Underground. 
            Johnston redesigned the Underground sign and logo to include his 
            typeface on the blue bar in the center of a red circle.<sup>[30]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            In the 1920s, Soviet constructivism applied 'intellectual 
            production' in different spheres of production. The movement saw 
            individualistic art as useless in revolutionary Russia and thus 
            moved towards creating objects for utilitarian purposes. They 
            designed buildings, film and theater sets, posters, fabrics, 
            clothing, furniture, logos, menus, etc.[31]
        </p>
        <p>
            
            Jan Tschichold codified the principles of modern typography in his 
            1928 book, New Typography.<sup>[32]</sup> He later repudiated the philosophy he 
            espoused in this book as fascistic, but it remained 
            influential.[citation needed] Tschichold, Bauhaus typographers such 
            as Herbert Bayer and László Moholy-Nagy and El Lissitzky greatly 
            influenced graphic design. They pioneered production 
            techniques[citation needed] and stylistic devices used throughout 
            the twentieth century. The following years saw graphic design in the 
            modern style gain widespread acceptance and application.<sup>[33]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            The professional graphic design industry grew in parallel with 
            consumerism. This raised concerns and criticisms, notably from 
            within the graphic design community with the First Things First 
            manifesto. First launched by Ken Garland in 1964, it was 
            re-published as the First Things First 2000 manifesto in 1999 in the 
            magazine Emigre 51[34] stating "We propose a reversal of priorities 
            in favor of more useful, lasting and democratic forms of 
            communication – a mindshift away from product marketing and toward 
            the exploration and production of a new kind of meaning. The scope 
            of debate is shrinking; it must expand. Consumerism is running 
            uncontested; it must be challenged by other perspectives expressed, 
            in part, through the visual languages and resources of design."<sup>[35]</sup>

            Graphic design can have many applications, from road signs to 
            technical schematics and reference manuals. It is often used in 
            branding products and elements of company identity such as logos, 
            colors, packaging, labelling and text.

            From scientific journals to news reporting, the presentation of 
            opinion and facts is often improved with graphics and thoughtful 
            compositions of visual information – known as information design. 
            With the advent of the web, information designers with experience 
            in interactive tools are increasingly used to illustrate the 
            background to news stories. Information design can include Data 
            and information visualization, which involves using programs to 
            interpret and form data into a visually compelling presentation, 
            and can be tied in with information graphics.

            The "process school" is concerned with communication; it highlights 
            the channels and media through which messages are transmitted and 
            by which senders and receivers encode and decode these messages. 
            The semiotic school treats a message as a construction of signs 
            which through interaction with receivers, produces meaning; 
            communication as an agent.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

        <h3>Typography</h3>
        <p>
            <i>Main article: <a href="#">Typography</i></a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Typography includes type design, modifying type glyphs and arranging 
            type. Type glyphs (characters) are created and modified using 
            illustration techniques. Type arrangement is the selection of 
            typefaces, point size, tracking (the space between all characters 
            used), kerning (the space between two specific characters) and 
            leading (line spacing).
        </p>
        <p>
            Typography is performed by typesetters, compositors, typographers, 
            graphic artists, art directors, and clerical workers. Until the 
            digital age, typography was a specialized occupation. Certain fonts 
            communicate or resemble stereotypical notions. For example, 1942 
            Report is a font which types text akin to a typewriter or a vintage 
            report.<sup>[36]</sup>

        <h3>Page layout</h3>
        <p>
            <i>Further information: <a href="#">Grid (graphic design)</i></a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Page layout deals with the arrangement of elements (content) on a 
            page, such as image placement, text layout and style. Page design 
            has always been a consideration in printed material and more 
            recently extended to displays such as web pages. Elements typically 
            consist of type (text), images (pictures), and (with print media) 
            occasionally place-holder graphics such as a dieline for elements 
            that are not printed with ink such as die/laser cutting, foil 
            stamping or blind embossing.
        </p>
        <h3>Grids</h3>
        <p>
            A grid serves as a method of arranging both space and information, 
            allowing the reader to easily comprehend the overall project. 
            Furthermore, a grid functions as a container for information and 
            a means of establishing and maintaining order. Despite grids being 
            utilized for centuries, many graphic designers associate them with 
            Swiss design. The desire for order in the 1940s resulted in a highly 
            systematic approach to visualizing information. However, grids were 
            later regarded as tedious and uninteresting, earning the label of
