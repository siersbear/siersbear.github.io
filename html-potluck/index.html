        <h3><u>Ingredients:</u></h3>
        <p>
            <b>For the cake:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons ube jam or ube halaya (purple yam jam)</li>
            <li>Purple food coloring (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <b>For the filling:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>1/4 cup powdered sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons ube jam or ube halaya</li>
        </ul>    
        <p>
            <b>For dusting:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Powdered sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><u>Instructions:</u></h3>
        <ol>
            <li><i>Preheat Oven:</i> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).</li><br>
            <li>Line a 10x15-inch jelly roll pan with parchment paper, leaving 
            an overhang on each side to easily lift the cake later.</li><br>
            <li><i>Prepare Batter:</i> In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs and 
            sugar together using an electric mixer until thick and pale yellow. 
            This usually takes about 5-7 minutes on medium-high speed.</li><br>
            <li><i>Add Oil and Vanilla:</i> Gradually add the vegetable oil and 
            vanilla extract to the egg mixture, mixing until well 
            combined.</li><br>
            <li><i>Combine Dry Ingredients:</i> In a separate bowl, sift 
            together the flour, baking powder, and salt.</li><br>
            <li><i>Incorporate Dry Ingredients:</i> Gently fold the dry 
            ingredients into the wet mixture until just combined. Be careful not 
            to overmix.</li><br>
            <li><i>Add Ube Flavor and Color:</i> Fold in the ube jam or ube 
            halaya into the batter. If desired, add a few drops of purple food 
            coloring to enhance the color.</li><br>
            <li><i>Bake:</i> Pour the batter into the prepared jelly roll pan 
            and spread it evenly with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 
            10-12 minutes or until the cake springs back when lightly 
            touched.</li><br>
            <li><i>Prepare Filling:</i> While the cake is baking, prepare the 
            filling. In a mixing bowl, whip the heavy whipping cream and 
            powdered sugar together until stiff peaks form. Gently fold in the 
            ube jam or ube halaya until evenly combined.</li><br>
            <li><i>Roll the Cake:</i> Once the cake is baked, immediately loosen 
            the edges with a knife. While still warm, carefully lift the cake 
            using the parchment paper overhang and transfer it onto a clean 
            kitchen towel sprinkled generously with powdered sugar.</li><br>
            <li><i>Rolling:</i> Starting from one of the shorter ends, gently 
            roll the cake and the towel together into a log. Allow the cake to 
            cool completely while rolled up.</li><br>
            <li><i>Fill the Cake:</i> Once cooled, carefully unroll the cake and 
            spread the prepared filling evenly over the surface, leaving a small 
            border around the edges.</li><br>
            <li><i>Roll Again:</i> Carefully re-roll the cake, this time without 
            the towel. </li><br>
            <li>Place the seam side down.</li><br>
            <li><i>Chill:</i> Wrap the cake roll in plastic wrap and refrigerate 
            for at least an hour to firm up before slicing.</li><br>
            <li><i>Serve:</i> When ready to serve, dust the cake roll with 
            powdered sugar and slice into rounds. Enjoy your delicious ube cake 
            roll!</li><br>
        </ol>

            This recipe yields a delightful ube-flavored cake with a creamy 
            filling, perfect for any occasion!

            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, cold and cut into small cubes</li>
            <li>3-4 tablespoons ice water</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <b>For the filling:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups mashed cooked purple yam (ube)</li>
            <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup evaporated milk</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>11 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon (optional)</li>
        </ul> 
        <h3><u>Instructions:</u></h3>
        <ol>
            <li><i>Prepare the dough:</i> In a large mixing bowl, whisk together 
            the flour and salt. Add the cold cubed butter and use a pastry 
            cutter or your fingertips to cut the butter into the flour until 
            the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li><br>
            <li><i>Add water:</i> Sprinkle 3 tablespoons of ice water over the 
            mixture and gently mix with a fork until the dough starts to 
            come together. Add additional ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, 
            if needed, until the dough forms a rough ball.</li><br>
            <li><i>Shape the dough:</i> Turn the dough out onto a lightly 
            floured surface and gently knead it a few times until it comes 
            together. Shape it into a disk, wrap it in plastic wrap, and 
            refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</li><br>
            <li><i>Roll out the crust:</i> After chilling, roll out the dough 
            on a lightly floured surface into a circle large enough to fit 
            your pie dish. Transfer the dough to the pie dish, trim any 
            excess dough from the edges, and crimp the edges decoratively. 
            Place the pie crust in the refrigerator while you prepare the 
            filling..</li><br>
            <li><i>Preheat oven:</i> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) for the 
            ube filling.</li><br>
            <li><i>Mix the filling:</i> In a large mixing bowl, combine the 
            mashed purple yam, granulated sugar, evaporated milk, eggs, 
            melted butter, vanilla extract, salt, and ground cinnamon 
            (if using). Mix until smooth and well combined.</li><br>
            <li><i>Pour into the crust:</i> Remove the prepared pie crust from 
            the refrigerator and pour the ube filling into it, spreading it 
            out evenly.</li><br>
            <li><i>Bake:</i> Place the pie in the preheated oven and bake for 
            45-50 minutes, or until the filling is set and the crust is 
            golden brown.</li><br>
            <li><i>Cool and serve:</i> Remove the pie from the oven and allow 
            it to cool completely on a wire rack before slicing and serving. 
            Optionally, you can serve it with whipped cream or vanilla ice 
            cream.</li><br>
        </ol>

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 1/4 teaspoons (1 packet) active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1/2 cup warm milk</li>

            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>Additional flour for dusting</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <b>For the topping:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 cup grated cheese (such as Edam or cheddar)</li>
            <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup breadcrumbs</li>
        </ul> 
        <h3><u>Instructions:</u></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Activate yeast: In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm milk. 
            Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until frothy.</li><br>
            <li><i>Add water:</i> Sprinkle 3 tablespoons of ice water over the 
            mixture and gently mix with a fork until the dough starts to 
            come together. Add additional ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, 
            if needed, until the dough forms a rough ball.</li><br>
            <li><i>Mix dry ingredients:</i> In a large mixing bowl, combine the 
            flour, sugar, and salt.</li><br>
            <li><i>Add wet ingredients:</i> Add the activated yeast mixture, 
            mashed purple yam, eggs, and softened butter to the dry 
            ingredients.</li><br>
            <li><i>Knead:</i> Mix everything until a dough forms. Transfer the 
            dough to a lightly floured surface and knead for about 8-10 
            minutes until smooth and elastic. Add more flour as needed if 
            the dough is too sticky.</li><br>
            <li><i>First rise:</i> Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it 
            with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm place for 
            about 1-1.5 hours or until doubled in size.</li><br>
            <li><i>Prepare ensaymada molds:</i> Grease ensaymada molds or muffin 
            tins with butter or cooking spray.</li><br>
            <li><i>Divide dough:</i> Punch down the risen dough and divide it 
            into equal portions, depending on the size of your molds. Roll 
            each portion into a ball.</li><br>
            <li><i>Shape ensaymadas:</i> Flatten each ball of dough into an oval 
            shape. Spread a small amount of softened butter on top of each 
            oval.</li><br>
            <li><i>Roll and shape:</i> Roll each oval into a log, then coil it 
            into a spiral shape, tucking the end underneath. Place each 
            shaped ensaymada into the prepared molds.</li><br>
            <li><i>Second rise:</i> Cover the molds with a clean kitchen towel 
            and let the shaped ensaymadas rise for another 30-45 minutes 
            until puffed up.</li><br>
            <li><i>Preheat oven:</i> While the ensaymadas are rising, preheat 
            your oven to 350°F (175°C).</li><br>
            <li><i>Prepare topping:</i> In a bowl, mix together the grated 
            cheese and granulated sugar.</li><br>
            <li><i>Top and bake:</i> Once the ensaymadas have risen, sprinkle 
            the cheese-sugar mixture evenly on top of each one. Then, 
            sprinkle breadcrumbs over the cheese-sugar mixture. Bake in 
            the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown.</li>
            <br>
            <li><i>Cool and serve:</i> Remove the ensaymadas from the oven and 
            let them cool in the molds for a few minutes before transferring 
            them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve warm or at room 
            temperature.</li>
